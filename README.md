# Wiki / Mind Garden

I am fascinated by the concept of creating and cultivating a mind garden. This here is the start of my personal wiki and mind garden. Maybe it's just here temporarily. Maybe it will stay here for a longer time, maybe I move it to somewhere else. However, for the time being, it will be on GitHub pages.

## Table of contents

* [eMobility](emobility.md) - We are owning an electric car now. Everything around what I learn about it, about charging, about keeping it I will document here.
* [StartUp](startup.md) - I have started to work with startups. There is a strong difference to working with or within large-scale organizations and I write about these differences in this article.

## About me

Probably the best way to find & contact me is by using the info on my website [oliverschwarz.info](https://oliverschwarz.info).
