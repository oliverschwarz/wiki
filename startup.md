# StartUp

After interacting with a few startups, I learned that there is a significant difference in the support they need to larger-scale companies. They don't need OKRs. They don't need sophisticated cultural aspects or high-level strategies (yet). They don't need leadership philosophies, but down-to-earth practice. They need tools, methods, habit-building, focus and transparency. Very often, you do not need to _find their why_ with them - at least not in the first run. They are usually enthusiastic and eager to help their customers and are genuinely nice people. They have a pretty good idea about their customer and are close to them, rarely are afraid of getting in touch with them.

So here is an attempt to (re-)structure my approach to company-building-on-the-fly.

**Background:** You are a tiny startup with a good idea and enthusiastic to get going.
