# StartUp

There is a significant difference between the support for startups and for larger-scale companies. Startups don't need OKRs. They don't need sophisticated cultural aspects or high-level strategies (yet). They don't need leadership philosophies and very often they don't need to learn about mindsets. They need tools, methods, habit-building, focus and transparency. Very often, you do not need to _find their why_ with them - at least not in the first run. They are usually enthusiastic and eager to help their customers and are genuinely nice people. They have a pretty good idea about their customer and are close to them, rarely are afraid of getting in touch with them.

**Background:** You are a tiny startup with a good idea and enthusiastic to get going.

The core element of working with startups is helping them to make progress and learn the basics of business on the way. Some already have a deep understanding of their motivation and the way how they want to do things, some have an obviously pretty successful idea, attracting customers and investors. Some are growing fast and struggle to keep up. However, I have rarely met a startup, that already excels in all areas, so your support work has to focus on identifying strength and weaknesses and then get alongside with them and then help to continuously improve.

## 5 dimensions

The work with startups can be structured into 5 dimensions. Each of them have the goal of:
1. Create and keep focus on value creation
1. Improve decision making
1. Enable learning to constantly improve in digestable chunks

### Let work flow

Removing obstacles, letting work start to flow through the "engine" is often one of the first things to address. Of course, everybody can simply work. However, rarely the company knows how much work they can handle, what are their lead times, what can be done until when and - not to forget - what _should_ be done in the first place. Letting work start to flow and get measures in place to make progress (and learn from it) needs to be put into practice first.

**Target:** Understand how value flows through your system and how every role, every person contributes to the value your company provides.

#### Find value streams

* Make your work visible
* Find 1 or 2 value streams
* Map them out (including their desired outcomes)
* Measure it and use reflection to incrementally improve your process

### Shape your product

Understanding, building and developing the product will help the company to generate an attractive result for their customers. Therefore it is important to understand the nature of the product, the facts and key figures around it, its strength and weaknesses. And it is important to start planning around it, roadmapping the future, think about basics like pricing, distribution and find the sweet spot where that one product cuts the difference for the customer.

#### Pricing strategies

* Value-based (high quality, tailored goods, craft)
* Competitive (saturated markets, commodities, w/ pressure on FMC)
* Price skimming (no competition, innovative, high demand, decreasing)
* Cost-plus (FMC + margin, check hidden production costs)
* Penetration/Disruption (undercut competition, then increase)
* Economy (commodities, low loyalty, large sales volume, save on FMC)
* Dynamic (hurts loyalty, pricing-on-demand, capitalise on demand, complex)

### Know your customer

Speaking of customer: Every company needs to understand its customers and how it is bringing value to them. Mainly most businesses are built around delivering a certain value to a customer, who then pays for it. Most often these businesses are in a competitive situation. There are practices, methods and principles which help improving the value creation towards the customers' needs. The basic calculation is easy: I am buying your product, if it provides a certain value to me. But what are values? Here are some examples:

* **Efficiency/Effectiveness** - I am able to do something more efficient or effective than before, which saves me time and effort
* **Enablement/Gain** - I am able to do something, that I could not do before, giving me a new capability
* **Entertainment/Muse** - The product brings fun and entertainment into my life
* **Self-Esteem/Pride** - Owning your product raises my feeling of self-esteem and self-worth
* **Pain relief** - Buying your product helps me get rid of a pain I have

#### Identify customer segments

To work towards the value creation and understanding of your customer, you can separate them in certain segments. Usually, each segments has a different set of values that they expect from your product. A segmentation example is B2B- vs. B2C customers or amateurs and professionals.

#### Create your value proposition

When you have an identified or assumed segmentation of your customers, you can start working on your value proposition. A simple way to get started is [Strategyzer's Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) - a free template that helps you structure the customers' needs, his/her pains and gains and your services and propositions. This should give you a good idea and reflection on whether you are really adressing your customers' needs.

#### Map your customer's journey

#### Important: Get feedback!

### Understand your business

When you know how work flows, what your product is and who is your customer (and what he/she needs), you need to orchestrate everything into a business. And your business needs to embrace the market of your products. You will need to understand how this all falls into place and becomes a unique organisation. Inside your organization you will need to communicate, so that everybody understands the relationship between business, markets and your product(s), too. Especially in large organizations and specialized silos this is important.

### Vision & Strategy

When you have proven your value to your customers and you have a balanced business, with focus, with ritualized learning, with a good overview on the work in your organization, you should start to work on your vision, derive the scope of the future and deploy a strategy to achieve your goals and work towards the vision. This should be lightweight, so that you can still focus on delivering value to your customers and getting your product out of the door.

Every startup has a different maturity in these 5 areas. Some are already great in their product concepts, some already have a good connection to their customers. Most of them are inspired, engaging, motivated people, eager to get things started and totally convinced and moved by their innovative ideas. The first steps need to focus on balancing these 5 aspects of the company - next to all the other stuff they will need to do: budgeting & finance, taxes, get a place to work, package and produce products (or lead production). Most often they feel overwhelmed by their opportunities, obligations and their lifes, so it is important to help them gain focus and create a practice around organizing work.

## Values

* Why are you doing what you are doing?

### About values

Your language needs to reflect the values that you want to live.

* "Action expresses priority" - Mahatma Gandhi

## Tiny bits

* Every human being strives for a position in stability & security. This is valid for organizations, too. To develop a change capability in an organization or company you have to design for phases of stability & security as well.
* There is an internal and external purpose of a company. Its value flow towards humanity, community and the world outside of the company and its value for the employees, the owner and all the people inside the company.
